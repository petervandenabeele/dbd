  ##
  # Basic Fact of knowledge.
  #
  # The database is built as an ordered sequence of facts, a "fact stream".
  #
  # This is somewhat similar to a "triple" in the RDF (Resource Description
  # Framework) concept, but with different and extended functionality.
  #
  # Each basic fact has:
  # * a unique and invariant *id* (a uuid)
  #
  #   To allow referencing back to it (e.g. to invalidate it later in a fact stream).
  #
  # * a *time_stamp*  (time with nanosecond granularity)
  #
  #   To allow verifying that the order in a fact stream is correct.
  #
  #   A time_stamp does not need to represent the exact time of the
  #   creation of the fact, but it has to increase in strictly monotic
  #   order in a fact stream.
  #
  # * a *context_subject* (a uuid)
  #
  #   The subject of the Context (a set of Contexts with
  #   the same subject) about this fact. Each Fact, points *back* to a
  #   Context (the Context must have been fully
  #   defined, earlier in a fact stream).
  #
  # * a *subject* (a uuid)
  #
  #   "About which Resource is this fact?".
  #
  #   Similar to the subject of an  RDF triple, except that this subject is not
  #   a URI, but an abstract uuid (that is world-wide unique and invariant).
  #
  #   Links to "real-world" URI's and URL's can be added later as separate facts
  #   (this also allows linking multiple "real-world" URI's to a single Resource).
  #
  # * a *predicate* (a string)
  #
  #   "Which property of the resource are we describing?".
  #
  #   Currently this is a string, but I suggest modeling this similar to predicate
  #   in RDF. Probably more detailed modeling using RDF predicate will follow.
  #
  # * an *object* (a string)
  #
  #   "What is the value of the property of the resource we are describing?".
  #
  #   Currently this is a string, but I suggest modeling this similar to object
  #   in RDF. Probably more detailed modeling using RDF object will follow.
