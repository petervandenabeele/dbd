    # Transforms the mixing class into an OrderedSet.
    #
    # On the mixing class, enumerable functions are possible,
    # looping over the set in O(n), but it is not intended
    # that the mixing class allows arbitrary access into
    # the collection.
    #
    # The *add_and_return_index* module method allows to get
    # an index to an added element, so indexes can be
    # built to access elements in O(1). The mixing class
    # should not expose this index to the added element in
    # it's public API. The goal is to allow other
    # implementations (e.g. with Hadoop, Neo4j, ...) with
    # the same API.
