014_escape_newlines_in_csv

As a user of the system
I can manipulate CSV files that are written by Dbd with basic
  UNIX command line tools (e.g. split by dates, merge, ...)
And the facts in that format are aligned by a newline
So, the newlines in the String object need to be escaped

* minimal profiling of write + read speed
* escape on writing, suggest:
  * "\n" => "\\n" (a back slash and a letter n)
  "C:\nuby" => "C:\\nuby"
  * do we need to escape a "real" backslash ??
    => yes, escape single backslash to double backslash

* unescape on reading, suggest:
  * "\\n" (backslash n) => "\n" (a newline)
  * "\\\\" (double backslash) => "\\" (single backslash)

* the magic upon unescaping is that a uneven amount of backslashes,
  followed by a 'n' can only be an escaped newline. A real
  "backslash n" will always trigger an even amount of backslashes
  in the escaped version.

* validate that write + read performance is not degraded too much
