014_escape_newlines_in_csv

As a user of the system
I can manipulate CSV files that are written by Dbd with basic
  UNIX command line tools (e.g. split by dates, merge, ...)
And the facts in that format are aligned by a newline
So, the newlines in the String object need to be escaped

* minimal profiling of write + read speed
* escape on writing, suggest:
  * "\n" => "\\n" (a slash and a letter n)
  * do we need to escape a "real" slash (or slash + n) now ??

* escape on reading, suggest:
  * "\\n" => "\n" (a newline)
  * what with a slash + n ?

* validate that write + read performance is not degraded too much
